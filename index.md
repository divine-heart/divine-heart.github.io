### Block Witch

Block Witch is a brightly coloured puzzle/action game in which the player controls one of many playable witches to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles in slide-on-ice puzzles!
<br><br>
My role in the project:
- Lead Programmer: All the programming is handled by me, with the goal of writing modular code and creating tools to make setup of the game a breeze for designers.
- Game Designer: Designed many of the mechanics, and generally being involved with all of the game's aspects. 
- Level Design: Designed most of the levels (~50) present in the prototype.
- Producer:  Setup sheets outlining all the content of the game, and assigned tasks to the team for various stages of the development cycle.
