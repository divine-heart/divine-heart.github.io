### Block Witch

Block Witch is a brightly coloured puzzle/action game in which the player controls one of many playable witches to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles in slide-on-ice puzzles!
<br><br>
My role in the project:
- Lead Programmer: All the programming is handled by me, with the goal of writing modular code and creating tools to make setup of the game a breeze for designers.
- Game Designer: Designed many of the mechanics, and generally being involved with all of the game's aspects. 
- Level Design: Designed most of the levels (~50) present in the prototype.
- Contributed to story and character concepts.
- Producer:  Setup sheets outlining all the content of the game, and assigned tasks to the team for various stages of the development cycle.

Check out the prototype's page on itch.io for more details, videos and a playable build!

### Math Learning RPG
Dissertation project for university. Outdated but interesting concept.
- Turn-based RPG with a twist: enemies are based on math subjects and attack with randomly generated math questions, answer correctly to avoid damage!!
