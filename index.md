## Block Witch

Block Witch is a brightly coloured puzzle/action game in which the player controls one of many playable witches to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles in slide-on-ice puzzles!
<br><br>
My role in the project:
- Lead Programmer: All the programming is handled by me, with the goal of writing modular code and creating tools to make setup of the game a breeze for designers.
- Game Designer: Designed player character abilities and many object mechanics. 
- Level Design: Designed most of the levels (~50) present in the Prototype.
- Contributed to story and character concepts.
- Producer:  Setup sheets outlining all the content of the game, and assigned tasks to the team for various stages of the development cycle.

### Block Witch at Cyprus Comic Con 2023!

Stardrop Games participated in Cyprus Comic Con 2023 as an Artist!
There was a new playable demo build made from the ground up in Godot 4, which is also downloadable from the itch.io page.
As a result of having less time to make the demo, it has a lot less content than the Prototype build (less levels, objects, no dialogue, no scoring system),
but the experience is more condensely polished.

Check out the itch.io for more details, videos of the CCC 2023 Demo and playable builds!
#### The CCC Demo build has less content but prettier graphics and support for controller.
#### The Prototype build contains a lot more levels, playable characters, dialogue and more objects, but graphics are barebones.

## Metroidvania Template
My own take on a Metroidvania with smooth physics, deep combat and puzzle solving. It is developed up to the point of needing to develop assets such as levels, cutscenes, enemies, graphics, etc...

## Math Learning RPG
Dissertation project for university. Outdated but interesting concept.
- Turn-based RPG with a twist: enemies are based on math subjects and attack with randomly generated math questions, answer correctly to avoid damage!!
