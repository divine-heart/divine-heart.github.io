## Block Witch

Block Witch is a brightly coloured puzzle/action game in which the player controls one of 7 playable witches to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles in slide-on-ice puzzles!

As lead programmer of the project, it was up to me to integrate the efforts of the whole team into the game while also making sure the game runs well on a wide range of machines.

## CybARverse

CybARverse is a VR & AR app for Meta Quest 3 funded by Erasmus+, to be used as additional material for a Cyber Security course. It is made using Unity, and I was responsible for all the programming, scenario design and script writing, based on the course's material. In the app, the user can go through various cybersecurity topics and visualize actions and mini-games.

Apologies for cutting off the beautiful voice acting, as this video is mainly to showcase the app's features and programming.

The rules and mechanics are kept very simple in order to accommodate the target audience: anyone looking for education!

The app also had to be optimized to run on the Meta Quest 3.
